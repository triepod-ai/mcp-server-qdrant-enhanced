# Collection Migration Status Report

**Date**: 2025-07-01 13:59:31  
**Issue**: Vector name mismatch detected - Configuration updated but data not migrated  

## Problem Analysis

**Expected Behavior**: Collections should use new 768D BGE-Base vectors  
**Actual Behavior**: Collection config shows `bge-base-en` but vectors still use `fast-all-minilm-l6-v2`  

**Root Cause**: Collection configuration was updated, but existing vector data remains in old format  

## Required Action

Need to perform actual data migration:
1. Delete existing collections (data backed up)
2. Recreate collections with new 768D models  
3. Restore data using MCP bulk_store tool
4. Verify new vector dimensions

## Data Safety

✅ **All data backed up** in `/migration-backups/20250701-085351/`  
✅ **Document counts verified**:
- resume_projects: 6 documents
- job_search: 17 documents  
- mcp-optimization-knowledge: 10 documents
- project_achievements: 35 documents

## Next Steps

Proceed with safe data migration using backup data.
