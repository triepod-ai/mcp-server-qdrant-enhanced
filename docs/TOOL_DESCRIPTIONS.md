# Tool Descriptions - Knowledge & Processes

## Overview

Tool descriptions are critical static documentation that inform users about MCP tool capabilities, requirements, and usage patterns. They serve as the primary interface between users and MCP server functionality, preventing errors and guiding proper usage.

## Core Principles

### 1. Static Documentation Philosophy
- **Never include dynamic data** (point counts, timestamps, current states)
- **Focus on capabilities** rather than current conditions
- **Provide consistent information** that won't become outdated
- **Document behavior patterns** rather than specific instances

### 2. Error Prevention Through Clear Guidance
- **Include explicit format requirements** (JSON syntax, parameter types)
- **Provide concrete examples** of correct usage
- **Address common pitfalls** proactively in descriptions
- **Use clear, unambiguous language** to prevent misinterpretation

### 3. Complete Feature Coverage
- **Document all model tiers** and capabilities
- **Include performance characteristics** where relevant
- **Explain auto-selection behaviors** and fallback strategies
- **Cover edge cases and error conditions**

## Tool Description Structure

### Essential Components
1. **Primary Function** - What the tool does
2. **Input Requirements** - Parameter types and formats
3. **Behavior Description** - How the tool operates
4. **Output Format** - What users can expect back
5. **Performance Notes** - Speed/efficiency characteristics
6. **Error Prevention** - Common mistakes and how to avoid them

### Format Template
```
[Primary Function]. [Specific Requirements/Format Guidance]. [Behavior Description with examples]. [Performance characteristics]. [Error handling/fallbacks].
```

## Lessons Learned from Qdrant MCP Enhancement

### Problem: JSON Syntax Errors
**Issue**: Users were using backticks (`) instead of double quotes (") in JSON metadata
**Root Cause**: Tool description didn't specify JSON formatting requirements
**Solution**: Added explicit JSON syntax guidance with examples

**Before**:
```
Store documents in Qdrant collections. Auto-creates collections with optimal models.
```

**After**:
```
Store documents in Qdrant collections with optional metadata. IMPORTANT: Use proper JSON syntax with double quotes (") for all keys and string values, not backticks (`). Example metadata: {"key": "value", "nested": {"data": 123}}.
```

### Problem: Incomplete Model Documentation
**Issue**: Tool descriptions only mentioned 768D and 384D models, omitting 1024D BGE-Large models
**Root Cause**: Descriptions weren't updated when new model tiers were added
**Solution**: Documented all three model tiers with specific use cases

**Before**:
```
Auto-creates collections with optimal models (768D BGE-Base for most collections, 384D MiniLM for simple tasks).
```

**After**:
```
Auto-creates collections with optimal models: 1024D BGE-Large for career/legal content (max precision), 768D BGE-Base for knowledge-intensive content, 384D MiniLM for technical solutions (speed).
```

### Problem: Dynamic Data in Static Descriptions
**Issue**: Including current point counts that become outdated
**Root Cause**: Confusion between tool descriptions (static) and tool output (dynamic)
**Solution**: Removed specific counts, focused on categorization

**Before**:
```
Top collections by volume: music_videos (66 points, 384D), legal_analysis (38 points, 1024D)
```

**After**:
```
Shows all collections with their embedding models: 1024D BGE-Large (legal/career), 768D BGE-Base (knowledge-intensive), 384D MiniLM (technical/debug).
```

## Process for Tool Description Updates

### 1. Analysis Phase
- **Identify the gap** - What's missing or incorrect?
- **Understand user impact** - How does this affect user experience?
- **Review current descriptions** - What needs to change?
- **Check for similar issues** - Are other tools affected?

### 2. Enhancement Phase
- **Write clear, specific guidance** - Address the root cause
- **Include concrete examples** - Show correct usage
- **Test against real scenarios** - Ensure descriptions prevent errors
- **Maintain consistency** - Use similar patterns across tools

### 3. Validation Phase
- **Review for static content** - No dynamic data included
- **Check completeness** - All features documented
- **Verify clarity** - Unambiguous language used
- **Test with users** - Confirm descriptions prevent errors

### 4. Deployment Phase
- **Update source code** - Modify tool registration
- **Rebuild containers** - Deploy updated descriptions
- **Verify deployment** - Test tools are working
- **Monitor usage** - Watch for remaining issues

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ **Be explicit about requirements** (JSON format, parameter types)
- ✅ **Include concrete examples** showing correct usage
- ✅ **Document all capabilities** including edge cases
- ✅ **Use consistent language** across related tools
- ✅ **Focus on user needs** rather than implementation details
- ✅ **Prevent common errors** through clear guidance

### Don'ts
- ❌ **Include dynamic data** (current counts, timestamps)
- ❌ **Use vague language** that can be misinterpreted
- ❌ **Assume user knowledge** about formats or requirements
- ❌ **Forget to update** when adding new features
- ❌ **Make descriptions too long** - keep them focused
- ❌ **Skip examples** for complex parameters

Example metadata: {"key": "value", "nested": {"data": 123}}. Auto-creates collections with optimal models: 1024D BGE-Large for career/legal content (max precision), 768D BGE-Base for knowledge-intensive content, 384D MiniLM for technical solutions (speed).
